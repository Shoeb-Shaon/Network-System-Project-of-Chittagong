This project was done when I enrolled into the Networking course during my University life. 
In this project I had to establish a dynamic network system where end devices can communicate with each other. 
To achieve that I had to find out the shortest path among those places . Configuring routers, Assigning IP by subnetting. Configuring all the routers. And many more features..
On the top of that, this project required a DHCP server and a SMTP server for email also.
